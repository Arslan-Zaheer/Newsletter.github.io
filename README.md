# Newsletter.github.io
In this Newsletter-Signup website, I practiced the following concepts related to API.

1) How to work with their APIs.
2) How to post data and communicate with Mailchimp's server.

It's a single page web site that looks pretty nice, and on the front-end it looks incredibly simple, but
on the backend it's got some powerful functionality that will allow you to sign people up to your mailing list

**NOTE:Enter your MailChimp API-KEY in app.js file (Line:40).**
